## Alice, the hackathon organizer
Alice is a hackathon organizer at Shopify! What a fun and interesting job :) She is trying to buy some spare computers and keyboards for hackers. She doesn't have a specific budget, but she is willing to spend the least amount of money, while maximizing the sets she can buy. She just paid a visit to Shopicruit store. Lets see how it went!

The total weight of the items Alice bought is 4936 grams; and the total amount of money she spent was 16.25 dollars.
